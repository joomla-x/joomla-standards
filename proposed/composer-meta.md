## 1. Summary

_What is Subject about?_

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP.  
Composer allows developers to specify project dependencies in a 
`composer.json` file and then Composer automatically handles the rest.

Composer makes it easier to keep vendor libraries out of your repo, 
meaning that only application code goes in the git repository.  

It also makes maintaining the latest versions of all required libraries 
easier because you can simply run `composer update` to get the latest 
compatible packages.  

Additionally, you can use Composer to manage extensions.
